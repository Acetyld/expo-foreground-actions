## 📍 Overview

The main goal of this library is to provide a way to run the **ios**: *beginBackgroundTaskWithName* and **android**: *startForegroundService* methods.

My goal for this library is to do what beginBackgroundTaskWithName was made for, start a action that could still be active when the user goes to the next app, for example, sending a chat message, creating a task or even running a sync.

On IOS we get roughly 30 seconds (mostly) and on android we can run a foreground task pretty long but ofcourse it always depends on the android model and their background policy.
But from my experience, you can safely run a foreground task for 30 seconds on both platforms.
But... remember doing a location tracking in background is not the goal of this library, this is because IOS only has 30 seconds on average, there are better alternatives for this like using a WorkManager or a GTaskScheduler

## 📦 Features

**IOS & Android**
- Run javascript while app went to background
- Run multiple foreground actions at the same time
- Force stop all foreground actions

**Android**
- Show a notification with a title and description and optional progress bar. Also support for linking.
- Support for new android 34+ background policy (so no actual notification is shown, but the foreground service is still running and it can be seen from the notification drawer)

**Ios**
- Be notified when the background time you get is almost over so you can save your data and stop the task.

**Web**
- Not fully supported, we suggest using runInJS for this because a error would be thrown if you try to run a foreground action on web.

## 🚀 Getting Started

***Dependencies***

Please ensure you have the following dependencies installed on your system:

`- ℹ️ Expo v49+`

`- ℹ️ Bare/Manage workflow, we do not support Expo GO`
### 🔧 Installation

1. Clone the expo-foreground-actions repository:

   **NPM**
    ```sh
    npm install expo-foreground-actions
    ```

   **Yarn**
    ```sh
    yarn add expo-foreground-actions
    ```

2. Install the plugin, for now download the repo and copy the plugins folder to your project root.
3. Then update your app.json to include the plugin and a scheme if u wanna use the plugin with a deeplink. <br/>https://docs.expo.dev/guides/linking/
    ```sh
   "expo": {
      "scheme": "myapp",
      "plugins": [
        [
          "./plugins/expo-foreground-actions"
        ]
      ],
   }
    ```

3. Make sure the plugin is loaded in your app.json, you can do this by running **prebuild on managed** or by running **pod install/gradle build** on bare.
