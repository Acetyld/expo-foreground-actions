# expo-foreground-action(s)
*Can run 1 action at the time, it holds the ID of last and can only start new one if the old one is "finished" or when you use forceStopForegroundedAction*

All big apps use it, "foreground" actions, there wasn't really a good library that had it full focus on foreground. For example in whatsapp you press "send". 
What happens? On ios it will ask for more time, so if the users closes the app it will continue, same for android!

So.. i made this, mostly because we needed it for our app that has some heave CRUD stuff and small syncs all starting from frontend ðŸ™‚
